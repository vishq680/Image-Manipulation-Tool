CONDITIONS ON COMMANDS:


1. Before executing any command, the image should be loaded into the application.


2. While loading, the location of the image should be valid and an image should be present in that    location.


3. Before dithering an image, the image should be converted into its greyscale version.


4. While executing a command (except load), the name of the image should be a valid name and an image by that name should be loaded into the application.


5. Before executing the rgb-combine command, the red, green, blue greyscale component should already be loaded and stored in the application.
